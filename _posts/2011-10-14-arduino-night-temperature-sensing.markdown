Hello everyone!

I hope you had a good time at the Arduino Night. I learned a LOT about temperature sensing and learned about reading serial data a bit more.(and using buffers!)

<a title="EEX96" href="http://www.eex96.com/">Jeremy Chan</a> has written up a little debrief for those who missed it. Check it out at his <a title="EEX96" href="http://www.eex96.com/" target="_blank">blog!</a>
