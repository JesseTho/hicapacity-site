_Do you want to take your Halloween costume to another level this year?_

_Have you been wondering how to get started on wearable or hackable electronic devices?_

Come to HICapacity! Next _Wednesday, October 14th (6-8pm)_ we will be giving a tutorial on getting started with Arduino microcontrollers. The event will be hosted by UH student, Jessica Grazziotin. Jessica will show you step-by-step how to make LED light up glasses for a cosplay piece. She will also show you all the tools you'll need to get started on projects of your own. This event is geared for beginners, so everyone from all ages and skill levels are invited to come check it out! 

Email us here <a href="mailto:jlblanke@hawaii.edu">jlblanke@hawaii.edu</a> with questions, to RSVP (helpful but not required) or if you would like to bring a project of your own! 

_What is an Arduino?_
Arduino is a popular brand of microcontrollers designed to be professional grade as well as user friendly. Basically anyone can do it (THAT MEANS YOU!)
