Can you tell the difference between a Mobile Application and a Web Application? 
Are you interested in learning about their differences and how they can affect your business? HICapacity's Edward Kim will be giving a presentation on what each technology is, how they differ from each other, how they can be used in your business, and if it makes sense to build one of your own. 

This presentation is aimed specifically at those that are not developers but are interested in staying up to date with the current trends in the technology industry. Developers are also welcome to share their own stories and experiences. Interaction between businesses and developers is highly encouraged and this event is just one way to continue the conversation.

The presentation will end with a break out session and a Q&A session where attendees can get tailored advice suited to their business. During the breakout session, attendees can try exercises that flex the advice given in the presentation or to get to know other attendees.

_Please note that there are two times for the event. There is one during the day from 2pm to 3pm and another at night from 7pm to 8pm._
