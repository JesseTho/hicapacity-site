The workshops will be Tuesday, Nov 10 - Thursday, Nov 12 from 10am-3pm. Volunteering earns you a free ticket! Otherwise tickets are $100 each. Volunteer experience can range from students to professionals. If you are available and interested in volunteering please email [jlblanke@hawaii.edu](jlblanke@hawaii.edu) with the days you are intersted in volunteering for.
