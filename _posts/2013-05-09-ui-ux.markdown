This talk is to inform others of the necessary steps in creating a website and understanding the importance of UI (User Interface) + UX (User Experience) design. These steps may seem tedious, but as you dive into the design or even the development stage, youâ€™ll quickly find out that this process will help to diminish problems that could occur down the road.
