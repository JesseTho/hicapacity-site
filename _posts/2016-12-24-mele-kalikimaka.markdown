Mele kalikimaka from HICapacity!  We've been making some changes to the space and membership. More info on our site [http://hicapcity.org](http://hicapacity.org).  HICapacity is member supported and we're about 10 members short on breaking even so we'd greatly appreciate any support as we enter the 2017.  

This year we are going to be making the move over to being a 501c non-profit organization as a learning and tech community.  As such we'd like the space to be more accessible by the community for events and support.

All regular members will now be able to get key cards to the space for 24/7 access (well as long as you don't live there..).  If you are student member you can get one right way by volunteering for offices hour. Message @taesup (ed@hicapacity.org) for both the form and the student rate code.

The space now has a new projector and streaming box that can be setup to stream events to Youtube, Twitch, and more. We'll be trying to make our streaming workshops available as they happen to everyone in the community. Check out our public event calendar and message @taesup (ed@hicapacity.org) if you'd like to to hold a community event or workshop.

Thanks to all our supporters, keep building, and have a happy New Year!
