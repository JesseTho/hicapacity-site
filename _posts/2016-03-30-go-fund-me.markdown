Hello everyone! Wow has it really been that long since we posted something? We apologize for not posting in a while! If you're looking for us we can always be found on our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/hicapacity/)!

Some of the members have been busy improving the space! HICapacity received some awesome shelving and we're putting it to good use! The space is looking more streamlined and organized.

More improvements are forthcoming and Jesse has setup a GoFundMe donation drive to help us achieve our space revamp. Our goal is to reach $2,500 and we're getting close! If you want to support us or see more details about what we're going to do with the funds please see the [GoFundMe page](https://www.gofundme.com/hjp7xuhw) for more info. Thank you to those who have already supported us!

We're going to be addressing two major pain points that we've always had. The need for decent seating (we currently have a mismash of partially broken office chairs) and the lack of AC after 7 PM. Even though we have windows they do little to help cool the space at night. The bulk of the funds will go toward buying us new chairs and a portable AC unit. The remainder will go to upgrading the technology in the space to support recording/streaming for presentations and additional storage solutions.

So what else have we been up to? Pretty much the same as last yer. We've been continuing with having talks at the space. In fact there is one tomorrow! It is titled [There's a Pheonix In My Elm Tree](https://hnl.io/events/256?n=There-s-a-Phoenix-In-My-Elm-Tree) and will be an introduction to using Elm with the Pheonix framework. Stop by if you can!

That's it for now! We will post photos of the space as we update it. We're extremely grateful to all the members and supporters for helping us to keep HICapacity going!
