There has been a lot of interest from HI Capacity members and the maker community to open a Makerspace. To keep the movement going, [The Box Jelly](http://theboxjelly.com/) has graciously allowed HI Capacity to create an interim Makerspace at it's location while we search for a more permanent home.

We will be open on Monday, October 10th.

**Hours of Operation**

Monday-Friday, 8am-12am
Saturday-Sunday, 11am-6pm

**Restrictions**

Certain evenings will be closed due to Box Jelly events. We will notify you in advance when the Makerspace will be closed.

**What is Provided**

* Space to work on software/hardware projects. Soldering is allowed.
* A limited amount of storage space to store your projects.
* Comfortable chairs and tables.
* Whiteboards.
* A community of people that want to do things!
* Check out the [perks](/perks) page for more details.

**Monthly Dues**

$50/month &mdash; Basic membership, which includes access to the space.

$75/month &mdash; This includes basic membership, a HI Capacity email address, and a personal web page on the hicapacity.org subdomain. You can advertise your membership or talk about your projects! Your additional contribution will go towards opening a larger Makerspace and equipment. By contributing a little more, you can help our Makerspace grow even faster!

Starving Hacker and Student rates are available. Please email maker(a)hicapacity.org
